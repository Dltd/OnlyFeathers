# ESP32-CAM custom mount

It took a few iterations to get to the mount that I used for the project.
I wanted it to be sort of modular so it would be easier to place/remove it during the testing phase, the first version was less ideal to debug or troubleshoot issues.

In the final version I only added an M4 bolt with two nuts on it as a counterweight so that it would keep the camera more focused to the center instead of the back that would be more visible if it would not be aimed properly, hence the many try out prints to make it work.
